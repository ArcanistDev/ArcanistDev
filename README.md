I am an enthusastic and heavily momentum based developer, 
primarily focused in Python and Rust for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.

Professionally I have served as both an in-house software developer 
and as an architecture consultant for artificial intelligence systems

I do my best work not by saying but by doing and iterating; though I will always 
keep my ear open to criticism and suggestions towards best/safer practices
